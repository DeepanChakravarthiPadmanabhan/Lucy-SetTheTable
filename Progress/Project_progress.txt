   * What did I do last week?
	- Implemented Factory method design pattern to integrate various other surfaces in future. 
   * What will I do in the following week?
	- Integration and work on another surface scenario.
	- Integrate the entire working node.
   * Do I have any problems which will prevent me from reaching our sprint goal? If yes, what?
	- Challenges in creating the bounding box or proof of concept for the second scenario.
	

Muhammad Umer Ahmed Khan:

   * What did I do last week? 
      - Visualization of Bounding box using python
   * What will I do in the following week? 
      - Complete compilation and remove erros
   * Do I have any problems which will prevent me from reaching our sprint goal? If yes, what? 
      - Currently, I am not sure how roslaunch works and would look into it. I am hopeful that I shall be able to fix it.

Deepan Chakravarthi Padmanabhan:

   * What did I do last week?
	- Cleaned the convex hull transformation.
	- Created the skeleton for the table setup package. To this package the other nodes created by the team members will be included along with the algorithm for table setup.
   * What will I do in the following week?
	- Look for ways to get the table configuration like width, corner points, etc.,
	- Complete the table setup node.
	- Integrate the entire working node.
   * Do I have any problems which will prevent me from reaching our sprint goal? If yes, what?
	- Transformation of the convex hull parallel to the floor. Though the transformation was determined by using static tf publisher, including the transformation to the pcl was difficult. Currently, I am planning to include the static tf publisher values in the launchfile.

Deepan Chakravarthi Padmanabhan:

   * What did I do last week? <br/>
      - Created the event_in trigger.
      - Created the launch file.
      - Faced challenges in reading the PCD point cloud data test file in the ROS node. The challenge has been overcome after discussing with Santosh.
      - Polygonstamped msg is published and the entire node is running as per the discussed requirements.
   * What will I do in the following week? <br/>
      - Set the table from the polygonstamped msg for the team members to visualize.
   * Do I have any problems which will prevent me from reaching our sprint goal? If yes, what? <br/>
      - Reading the pcd file in ROS.

Sathiya Ramesh:

   * What did I do last week? <br/>
      - POC for setting the objects on the table in python
   * What will I do in the following week? <br/>
      - Create the transformation functions in c++
   * Do I have any problems which will prevent me from reaching our sprint goal? If yes, what? <br/>

Deepan Chakravarthi Padmanabhan:

   * What did I do last week? <br/>
      - Created a node for convex hull input. This node will provide the convex hull obtained from the pointcloud data as PolygonStamped msg to the central task node.
   * What will I do in the following week? <br/>
      - Convexhull input node will be modified depending on the central node topics/ requirements of the project.
      - Yet to be decided in the meeting.
   * Do I have any problems which will prevent me from reaching our sprint goal? If yes, what? <br/>
      - First time developing a ROSNode from scratch. It was challenging and interesting to work.
      - Converting the pcl convex hull to polygonstamped msg.

Muhammad Umer Ahmed Khan:

   * What did I do last week? <br/>
      - Constructed spoons, plate and tables classes.
      - Visualized the classes.
      - Added Deepans work for visualization.
   * What will I do in the following week? <br/>
      - Work on configuration files for the project
   * Do I have any problems which will prevent me from reaching our sprint goal? If yes, what? <br/>
      - Unable to visualize all items at once.

Sathiya Ramesh:

   * What did I do last week? <br/>
      - Trannsformation of bounding box
      - Reading the poses from config file
   * What will I do in the following week? <br/>
      - Visualize the transformed bounding box
   * Do I have any problems which will prevent me from reaching our sprint goal? If yes, what? <br/>
      - Errors in reading the yaml file

Deepan Chakravarthi Padmanabhan:

   * What did I do last week? <br/>
      - Constructed a convex hull from a table point scene point cloud, and visualized the bounding box of the convex hull in rviz.
   * What will I do in the following week? <br/>
      - Should develop a ROSNode providing convex hull input to the central node.
   * Do I have any problems which will prevent me from reaching our sprint goal? If yes, what? <br/>
      - I was not able to understand the perception libs code. As I was unable to understand I wrote a small program to construct bounding box from the convex hull.
