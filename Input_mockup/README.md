## Title: Set the table

## Information:
This folder contains convex hull input node which takes in a table scene point cloud data and publishes the convex hull in three types- point cloud, polygonstamped msg and bounding box for testing purpose. The bounding box for the convex hull is constructed and visualized using mcr\_scene\_segmentation libraries.
